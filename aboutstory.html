                    <p>More and more people in the general public are now aware of the enormous benefits of Neurofeedback and Biofeedback in restorative and preventive health interventions. This has led to the opening of many centers that offer neurofeedback and biofeedback interventions or services in the Asia Pacific.

                        APNA was formed out of the concerns the following groups:</p>

                            These clinicians are also Medical doctors, Psychologists, Counselors, Naturopaths and other certified health practitioners.

                        <p>There is a growing number of researchers in bio-engineering, neuro-cognitive sciences and medical & health sciences in the AP region.

                            These researchers are from universities and research institutes. There is often a disjoint between research and clinician applications.

                        <p>As more people come to know of the health benefits of neurofeedback, the demand for this type of intervention grew rapidly. But most people are unclear as to what this intervention modality is and how it works.
