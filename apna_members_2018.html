                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Topic: <br>Epilepsy is a group of neurological disorder characterized by sudden recurrent episodes of sensory disturbance, loss of consciousness, or convulsions, associated with abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Nearly one-third of patients with epilepsy do not benefit from medical treatment. Electroencephalography neurofeedback therapies have been recognized as one of the promising treatment for the different types of epilepsy patients. Through EEG neurofeedback training, it is possible to train the brain to de-emphasize brain electrical activity that leads to generation and propagation of seizure and emphasize rhythms that make seizures less likely to occur. This presentation focuses the current practice and experience on the effect of EEG neurofeedback to reduce seizure frequency and duration. It is clear that EEG neurofeedback training has a positive impact on most of the recent studies reviewed. These findings are limited due to multiple confounding factors in their techniques and protocols. Despite these limitations, the promising role of neurofeedback as a treatment to reduce the seizures is well recognized.</p>

Also received Research Award-2017 by International Stress Management Association.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Topic: <br>Neurofeedback, also known as EEG biofeedback or EEG operant conditioning, is a way of training the brain to use more productive patterns of brainwaves. It is a non-invasive treatment, which teaches the brain to self-regulate, strengthening neural pathways while increasing mental endurance and flexibility. In Neurofeedback training, the EEG placement typically includes a few electrodes at target sites according to the International 10–20 system and the basis of treatment protocol is to address an identified deficit or excess of a particular frequency band relative to a set of bands observed in the subject or patient at initial intake.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">The therapeutic outcome of Neurofeedback and its clinical effect crucially depend on electroencephalography (EEG), which measures cortical activity from the scalp without precise knowledge of the recorded cerebral structures. An accurate and reliable mapping between external anatomical landmarks and internal cerebral structures is therefore fundamental to localize brain sources in a non-invasive way. EEG waves are the result of the summation of the EPSPs and IPSPs across the membranes of many neurons. Any voltage change which appears as an EEG wave is the result of the more or less synchronized activity of a large number of neurons occupying an area of about 6 cm. As it is known from tomography different brain areas may be related to different functions of the brain and each scalp electrode is located near certain brain areas. German anatomist Korbinian Brodmann published maps of cortical areas in 1909 assuming that different structures served different functions, the most widely known and frequently cited cytoarchitectural organization of the human cortex. An understanding between the 10/20 electrode positions and their corresponding closest Brodmann are described in this discussion.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Besides the socio-behavioral and cognitive outcomes, recent studies have also shown that Neurofeedback is found to increase gray matter volume in the selected brain areas. Accurate feedback also increases white matter volume, strengthening connections between brain areas. There are evidences of dopaminergic changes due to Neurofeedback protocols using positron emission topography (PET). Training Neurofeedback frequencies may also modulate dopamine as well or other neurotransmitter systems such as serotonin and GABA.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">The aim in this paper is to study the evidences from Neurofeedback literature to find the anatomical and physiological correlation of EEG based operant conditioning that might highlight the therapeutic effect of Neurofeedback and its influence on changing brains structure and function. The knowledge of brain anatomy and physiology and the electrochemical understanding remains essential for effective Neurofeedback therapy.</p>

                    <p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">Microstate Analysis to Represent Levels of Stress</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Nidal Kamel received the M.Sc and PhD degree (Hons) from the Technical University of Gdansk, Poland, in 1993. His PhD work was focused on subspace-based array signal processing for direction of-arrival estimation. Since 1993 he has been involved in research projects related to estimation theory, noise reduction, optimal filtering, and pattern recognition. He developed SNR estimator for antenna diversity combining, single-trial subspace-based technique for EEG extraction form brain background noise, and introduced a subspace-based data glove system for online signature verification. His present research interest is in brain signal processing, image enhancement, and pattern recognition. Currently, he is Associate Professor at the PETRONAS University of Technology. He is IEEE senior member.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Topic: <br>Stress is generally known as a situation of too much expectation under sheer pressure that is hardly controlled. Psychological and social stress exist in daily life, which affects emotional behavior, job performance, mental and physical health and ultimately quality of life. Psychosocial stress is a principal cause of numerous psychophysiological disorders. For example, it rises the chances of depression, stroke, heart attack and cardiac arrest. The treatment of stress needs it to be quantized into levels first. Clinical evaluation of stress relies on questionnaires and interviews, which are subjective methods. On the other hand, objective indicators of stress rely on stress-related physiological changes.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Modern neuroscience acknowledges that human brain is the main object of mental stress because perception of human brain defines a situation threatening and stressful. The information exchange in the brain regions is through action potential, that is small electrical discharges in brain cells. These actions potentials can be noninvasively measurable at the surface of the scalp using electroencephalography (EEG). As stress initiates in the brain, the EEG signals become a good measure to analyze stress. EEG is an important method of assessing the real-time information of the large-scale brain networks with high temporal resolution. Conventionally, EEG analysis relies mainly on the power distribution in different frequency bands at EEG channels. However, these observations come at the expense of temporal accuracy due to time-frequency uncertainty principle. The description of transient variations of neuronal activity requires the time-domain analysis that account for such temporary changes. Microstate analysis is one such time-domain analysis in which topography of the scalp electric potential is evaluated. The topography remains unchanged for about 80-120 millisecond. These are quasi-stable periods and called the microstates of EEG. Microstates can describe the qualitative aspects of spontaneous thinking. This suggests that they indicate various types of mental processes. Surprisingly, the rest condition consistently produces only four microstates which reproduce across subjects for entire lifespan, indicating they might be mediated by predetermined anatomical connections. Variations of microstates have been reported in schizophrenia, depression, alzheimer’s and as a function of drug administration and hypnosis.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">To this end we have investigated whether the sequence of four microstates reveals scale-free dynamics of psychosocial stress levels. Workplace stress was assessed using the depression, anxiety and stress (DASS) questionnaire and the workplace stress scale (WSS). Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded in eyes closed condition for five minutes. The analysis produced four microstates that correlated well the original EEG data in different levels of stress. The correlation coefficients were above 0.5 among microstate maps and EEG data in every level of stress, indicating that the microstate maps were strong representatives of the maps of original EEG data. Although the results indicated that microstates have positive outcome in stress research, yet the methodology requires further improvement and thorough analysis including the relationship with other factors as well as the transition among the microstate maps.</p>

                    <p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">Unlocking the Potential of Neuro & Physio Feedback: Adoption in Mainstream Healthcare and Home</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Dr. Subhasis has over 20 years of experience in developing cutting-edge technology, 5 years of practicing therapy and 10 years in clinical research. His diverse background led him to invent and commercialize the world's first fully wearable and connected brain plasticity training tool that trains Brain and Body as parts of ONE system. SynPhNe is the outcome of his PhD (Biomechatronics) study. He is involved in research in biomechanics, neuroplasticity, movement analysis, learning mechanisms and ageing. He has been a yoga and martial arts practitioner for the past 25 years.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Topic: <br>Thousands of patients have benefited in various ways thanks to practitioners who use neuro and bio-feedback. However, these modalities still remain poorly adopted by mainstream healthcare and also at patients' homes. With the increasing attention in research and practice to the human brain and neuroplasticity, the opportunities for adoption in mainstream healthcare and homes is real and enormous. What is required is a co-ordinated effort between clinicians, practitioners, engineers and design professionals to leverage this unique opportunity for the benefit of patients, care-givers and practitioners. This presentation shares the story of how SynPhNe found commercial adoption in mainstream hospitals just four years after starting its journey, walking the edge between med-tech and consumer electronics, and balancing regulatory requirements with patient expectations.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Ting Min is a psychology graduate from the National University of Singapore. She is a certified neurofeedback therapist (SBCIA) and is a consultant at Spectrum Learning Pte Ltd, Singapore. She has worked as a Neurofeedback therapist since 2005 at Spectrum Learning.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">She has successfully helped many clients with neurofeedback therapy. Her clientele base is very varied from young children to elderly adults, and across different disorders, from cognitive, emotional, epilepsy, migraines and etc.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Topic: <br>The case studies will discuss how neurofeedback helped two clients with their learning challenges. One of the client was diagnosed with GDD at the age of 5, while the other with mild intellectual impairment at the age of 8. In today’s competitive learning environment, coupled with their learning difficulties, which often lead to low self-confidence, self-esteem and isolation behaviour, these clients struggle in the school system. With neurofeedback, improvements were observed in terms of their learning ability as well as emotional well-being.
                        qEEG brain mapping was used to assess the brain functioning of the clients prior to the start of neurofeedback training. Findings from qEEG of each client will also be discussed. Based on these findings, together with primary objectives to be achieved, neurofeedback training protocols were determined and outcome seen.</p>

There were numerous studies that focus on using neurofeedback to help addiction patients, and different protocols were applied.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">In this case study, a 36 year old female came with an addiction to stilnox. She said that she has been taking 10-20 stilnox per night for the past five years. She is seeing a psychiatrist for medication such as remeron 60 mg, quetiapin 10 mg and 2 tablets of stilnox. Her additional stilnox are given by a private clinic. She has seen a clinical psychologist for a year but her addiction and sleeping problem still persist.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">She is at present seeing a counselling psychologist and was referred for neurofeedback to complement the counselling goals. Several protocols are used to help her cope with her addiction and sleeping problem. The outcome of neurofeedback is positive so far in helping addiction patient.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Topic: <br>Trauma can be caused by various different circumstances. These circumstances can be grief, sexual abuse, physical abuse, domestic violence, or even verbal abuse. When a person goes through a traumatized event, he or she might encounter assorted mental and physical discomfort. Multiple studies found that trauma itself could lead to a dissociative state on the victim. A dissociative state is a trance-like state, which is commonly experienced by individuals who suffer from dissociative disorder, panic attack, and etc. An individual who is in the state of dissociation may show certain unique brain arousal patterns which could be studied via brain mapping method. The common symptoms of dissociative state that are associated with brainwaves pattern are a lack of concentration, facing complication in verbalizing their feelings, suffering from psychosomatic pain, anxiety and depression, as well as learning difficulties. The case studies will discuss how to relate specific brainwave patterns via QEEG brain mapping method and unique trauma-informed treatment plan to deal with the dissociative state caused by the traumatic incidents.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Topic: <br>Electroencephalographic (EEG) findings on depressive patients indicate theta and alpha activity higher than in normal controls. Extensive literature reports on the effectiveness of neurofeedback techniques in the treatment of cognitive and behavioral disorders by training the patients to modulate their brain activities, as reflected in their electroencephalogram. Neurofeedback (NFB) training presented promising, non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies for depression. Methods: 30 adults (average age 34.7) with symptoms of depression underwent 20 sessions of NFB training. Along with the pre- and post-treatment Depression Rating Scales assessment – Back Depression Inventory (II) BDI-II, and qualitative interviewing respond. Results: After NFB training, symptoms of depression (p < .001, dz = 4.34) were reduced in those depression individual. The majority of individuals with pre-treatment symptoms of depression (89.1%) experienced improvements of clinical importance. There were also significant changes in EEG. Conclusion: From the evidence, NFB provides an effective, non-pharmaceutical intervention to reduce symptoms of depressive individuals. Additionally, NFB also improve their brain EEG. Along with remission of the clinical symptoms of depression, significant decrease of theta power over frontal and central areas was observed in all patients under the test conditions compared with the control group sample. Four samples of these qEEG dynamics show correlate of NF-related recovery to the appropriate level in the frontal cortical activation.</p>
